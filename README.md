oh man just tumbled out of Cleaner, still feeling like I’m stuck in some soap-sudded trance, holding onto this phone like I’m about to call a cab but really just typing to you instead… theater was so LOUD, my ears are buzzing like a swarm of espresso-fueled bumblebees. popcorn crumbs all over me, like I sat through some kind of tornado.

so, Cleaner… where do I even start? this   is like mopping the floor with all your expectations. that scene with the mop… can anyone even handle a mop like that? I mean, I sat there thinking, “who knew cleaning could look so… heroic?” if my kitchen floor could talk, it’d be ashamed of its mere existence. and then there's the bucket – it’s like a sidekick that never gets the spotlight but you know it’s holding everything together. or maybe I'm just losing it, could be the sore back from these unforgiving seats.

the plot? kind of like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded with oven mitts on. but kinda fun? I guess confusion has its own flavor, like burnt toast — slightly intriguing, mostly charred curiosity. > right in the middle, this janitor guy (what was his name? Dave? or was it Steve?) flips the entire narrative like he’s trying to catch a fly with chopsticks but ends up with a dragonfly. or maybe it wasn't a dragonfly but I lost track around there, too busy wriggling to get comfy. the whole thing blurs in your memory like your face reflected on a dirty window. oh, remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   cause someone wanted that, right?

anyways, imagine a broomstick turning into a swordfight — not your everyday cleaning job, y'know? and somewhere amidst this chaos, I was reminded of Grandma’s old cuckoo clock, ticking away timelessly as the characters race against the clock. that weird bird popping out at the hour... Would make more sense than where the plot was heading sometimes. why did the raccoon have to show up in the middle of everything??

oh yeah, someone asked if they should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , didn’t they? I would. if only for the sheer adrenaline of not knowing what the heck is going on but being completely here for it.

and here I am, trying to make sense of it all while these theater speakers still echo in my head like nineties dial-up. leaving this snippet that got left in my mind somehow:

```cpp
// totally unrelated, ignore:
int main() {
    int n = 0;
    while(n < 10) {
    clean();
    }
    return -1;
}
```

what was that doing here?? gotta rub my temples and dust off, going home.
